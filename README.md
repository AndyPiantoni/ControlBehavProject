To visualize the full chasing scenario you need to run the final_courtship_scenario.ipynb notebook 
for the acceptation scenario set the peak odor intensity as such:
peak_odor_intensity = np.array([[1, 0],[1, 0]])
and for the rejection scenario as such: 
peak_odor_intensity = np.array([[0, 1],[1, 0]])

Kikcing.ipynb and mounting.ipynb can be run to see how the kicking action, abdomen curling and lunging action are implemented 
The rest of the files are dependencies or preliminary versions.
